 PyMC console
==============

        PyMC is now sampling. Use the following commands to query or pause the sampler.
        

        Commands:
          i -- index: print current iteration index
          p -- pause: interrupt sampling and return to the main console.
                      Sampling can be resumed later with icontinue().
          h -- halt:  stop sampling and truncate trace. Sampling cannot be
                      resumed for this chain.
          b -- bg:    return to the main console. The sampling will still
                      run in a background thread. There is a possibility of
                      malfunction if you interfere with the Sampler's
                      state or the database during sampling. Use this at your
                      own risk.
